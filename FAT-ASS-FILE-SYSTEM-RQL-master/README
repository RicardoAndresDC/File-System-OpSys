Log + Division of Labor///////////////////////////
	All team members have no complaints about divisions of labor
	While Luiz definitely handled most of the typing, Quinton and Luiz were
	both present, feeding relevant info and a part of the decision making process
	for the project. 

	Most of our development faced issues with getting the preliminary functions to work,
	and as such, worrying over them lead to a prolonged hiatus from handling the others.
